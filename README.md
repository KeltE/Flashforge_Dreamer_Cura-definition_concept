# Flashforge_Dreamer_Cura-definition_concept
# Use and test at you own risk!

This is the ongoing Cura definition for Flashforge Dreamer.

This is my vision and attempt to make a dual extruder printer profile for Cura. Profile is made Use my Dreamer NX profile.
Since you only have the Flashforge Dreamer MX (Single extruder Dreamer), it has not been tested and definitely needs to be configured.

I have no idea how the Dreamer uses the offset of different nozzles. And I also don't know which nozzle is T0 and which is T1.
As I understand it, I think there is also a problem with the T0 G-code generated by Cura before the start code.

Hopefully someone can continue where I left off.
