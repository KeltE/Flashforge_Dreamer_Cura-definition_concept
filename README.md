# Flashforge_Dreamer_Cura-definition_concept
# Use and test at you own risk!

This is the ongoing Cura definition for Flashforge Dreamer.

This is my vision and attempt to make a dual extruder printer profile for Cura. Profile is made Use my Dreamer NX profile.
Since you only have the Flashforge Dreamer MX (Single extruder Dreamer), it has not been tested and definitely needs to be configured.

As I understand it, I think there is also a problem with the T0 G-code generated by Cura before the start code.

Hopefully someone can continue where I left off.

# Installing.
